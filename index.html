            <p>Welcome to my story of Singapore trip. I am going to explain how I enjoyed my Singapore trip and how exciting it was. I was staying for 5 nights 6 days. it was quite a long trip. I started from the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad. The reason I was going on this trip was because of my mother and father's anniversary. My flight time was at 3:00 A.M, I was at the Airport at 12:00 A.M. I had checked in the main luggage and went to the immigration. There was a big queue. After it was done, I went to check the cabin luggage, there I saw a New Zealand Cricketer {Glenn Phillipes} I did not believe it. I quickly went to ask for a photo. He gave it to me. I was so happy that I was speechless. I checked the cabin luggage and it was done quite fast. The time was 2:00 A.M, I went into the gate and I was bored. On the way my father saw a book shop and he told "Go buy a book and read it." I said "ok let's go" I went to the book shop and bought the book called "Abdul Kalaam MY INDIA". I went back to the gate and boarded the flight. I have sat on the flight ready to takeoff. The flight took off, it was 4 hours 15 mins away.</p>
